Tips I read were to require usage of cheaper models like Sonnet for the agents, and allow more expensive like Opus for the team lead.

```
## Execution
- Create an agent team to explore implementation of the above
- One team member should be on UI/UX in the browser interface
- One team member should be on designing the integrations
- One team member should be on designing the multiple company structure
- One team member should ensure a standardized data model is adhered to
- Use Sonnet models for all four team members
- Use Opus for the team leader
```
